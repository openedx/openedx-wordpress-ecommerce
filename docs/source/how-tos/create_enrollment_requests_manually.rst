About the Enrollment Request View
----------------------------------

Fields
^^^^^^^
- Course ID: the ID from your Open edX platform course. e.g. course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course. 

- User Email: the user's email address that will be used in the request.

- Course Mode: the mode of your enrollment request. Make sure to set a mode that your course has. We only support the modes that come by default on the Open edX platform.

- Request type: If you select **Enroll**, you will create an enrollment, and if you choose **Un-enroll**, you will set a soft unenrollment (enrollment with status inactive) if you update in Open edX.

- WC Order ID: This field will fill automatically if your request has an order associated with it; you can use it to navigate from the Enrollment Request to the Order.

Flags
^^^^^^

- Use the "force" flag: if you select this, the action will not consider the course enrollment end dates.

- Creating a course enrollment allowed if the user doesn't exist: if you select this, create a register in the table Course Enrollment Allowed if the email we use in the request is not a user in our Open edX platform yet. It is available only if you have a release greater or equal to Quince.

Buttons
^^^^^^^^

- Save in WordPress: this allows you to store the form information in WordPress.
- Save and update Open edX: save the information in WordPress and create a POST API request, considering all the flags and fields except the "WC Order ID."
- Read from Open edX: bring information with GET methods over the API and only use the "Couse ID" and "User email" fields.
- View Order: allows you to navigate from the Enrollment Request to the Order associated with that request.
