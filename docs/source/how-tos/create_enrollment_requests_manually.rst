Create enrollment requests manually
====================================

The Open edX WooCommerce Plugin uses Enrollment Request to manage the enrollments generated by the WooCommerce integration, but you can create an Enrollment Request manually.

In this section, you will learn how to create an Enrollment Request manually.

Requisites
-----------

To connect with the Open edX platform, you must have valid settings for this plugin. If you don't have this plugin set yet, the how-to :doc:`Create an Open edX Application for the Plugin Settings </how-tos/create_an_openedx_app>` will be helpful.

Steps
------

#. Enter the Enrollments Manager option in your WordPress dashboard's Open edX Sync tab.

* Use a valid course ID that will be used in the request. e.g. course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course.

* Enter the email of the user who will be used in the request.

* Select a Course Mode that the course has.

* Select the type of request you want to execute. If you select Enroll, you will create an enrollment, and if you select Un-enroll, you will set a soft unenrollment (enrollment with status inactive).

* If this request has an Order associated, you can fill in the "WC Order ID" field.

* If you select to use the force flag, the action will not consider the course enrollment dates.

* Creating a "course enrollment allowed" if the user doesn't exist is available only if you have a release greater than Palm.

And that's it!

You can save it in Wordpress or Save and Update it in Open edX.
